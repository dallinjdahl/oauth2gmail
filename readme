oauth2gmail

These three scripts are intended to enable easy access to the refresh
and access tokens for an application to use.  This enables oauth2 access
to gmail with desktop clients, without requiring python.

To enable these scripts to work, you must have your client_id and
client_secret from your project at:

https://console.developers.google.com/

This project must have the gmail API enabled, and credentials generated.

The client_id should go in a file called 'client_id' in this directory.
Likewise, the client_secret should go in a file named 'client_secret'
also in this directory.

auth.sh
This script generates a link to visit for you to generate an auth code,
proving this is desired access.

token.sh
This script generates a refresh token.  This is effectively the equivalent
of a password, together with your client_id and client_secret.

refresh.sh
This script generates an access token and it's expiration time in seconds.
This is what is actually used to access gmail, and must be refreshed
after expiration.  The first line of 'access_token.sh' contains the
access token, and the second line contains the seconds until expiration.
